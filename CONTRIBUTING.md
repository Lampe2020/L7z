# Contribution guide   
> *Note that this guide will change as the project evolves, so check by from time to time!*   

Please be friendly to everyone you communicate with through this project. That means, no swearing in code or issue/PR 
comments, no snarky or snide comments, and of course mandatory use of common sense. This project should be a nice place 
to write code together with the goal of creating and maintaining a GUI for 7-zip for Linux and other *NIXes.   

## Code Guidelines   
* Tab width: 4 spaces (should when possible actually be inserted as spaces, not tab characters)   
* Max line length: 120 characters (the PyCharm default right margin line position)   
* Comments should be tab-aligned (the first character starting the comment should be on a position in the line 
  divisible by four if the first character in each line is character 0)

# Issues and PRs   
If you see a problem in the program and it hasn't been reported yet, feel free to open an Issue on GitHub.   
If you can fix any reported issues yourself, feel free to do so in your own fork of the project and then open a PR[^1] 
to get your fix merged into the main project. If you do so, please follow the above guidelines.   



[^1]: PR stands for "Pull Request". You may know it as MR ("Merge Request") from other platforms, but in this project 
we call it PR inline with how GitHub calls it.
